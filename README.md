Capstone Project # 2
Churn Prediction Capstone_Project is part of Harvard PH125.9 course.

DataSet: This project is based on sample data from IBM Sample DataSets for customer retention programs which will be used to create churn prediction models. The dataset is available at below location:

- [Telco CHurn dataset] https://community.watsonanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv?cm_mc_uid=58920755505115141495567&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1514149556&cm_mc_sid_52640000=1514149556"


Target: The target of this project is to predict behavior of customer attrition i.e. whether customer will churn or not churn, based on churn prediction model which will, in turn, help to improve customer loyalty and retention. 

Key Steps: In this project, we will use the above mnetioned telco churn dataset. Major steps for this project is detailed as below:  

* Load the data and do initial exploration  
* Insight analysis and vizualization 
* Data Cleansing & Preprocessing
* Build 5 models based on the churn training dataset   
* Validate the models performance for test dataset.
